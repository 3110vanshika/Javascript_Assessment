## Write a JavaScript program to find the area of a triangle where lengths of the
three of its sides are 5, 6, 7.

const a = 5;
const b = 6;
const c = 7;

//calculate the semi perimeter
const s = a + b + c / 2;

//calculate the area
const area = Math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));

document.write("Area of triangle is : " + area);
